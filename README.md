# PowerRelic

## What do you need to make this work?

Required:

  * This module was built to be compatible with PowerShell v 6.0+ (aka "[PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)") for cross-platform compatibility and to take advantage of the [-FollowRelLink](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-core-60?view=powershell-7#web-cmdlets) switch added to the [Invoke-RestMethod](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-restmethod?view=powershell-7) cmdlet.
